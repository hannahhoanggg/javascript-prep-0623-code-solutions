## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  The five parts of a function defintion are defining functions, calling functions, returning from functions, naming functions, and anonymous functions.
- How do you call a function?
  You call a function by defining it first and then you call the function for the code within its code block to run. It causes the code block within the function's definition to be executed.
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  A parameter is a placeholder, which is a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument. When the function's code block is run, the parameter is holding the value of the argument. When we define a function, we delcare parameters and we call a function to pass the arguments.
